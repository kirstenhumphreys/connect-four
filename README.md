##Project One - Connect Four

###Overview:

An updated take on the classic 'Vertical Checkers' game - Connect Four. To play the game the players must strategically place their pieces on the board in order to create a four-in-a-row match. This match can be vertical, horizontal, or diagonal. Whichever player is first to get a match wins!
